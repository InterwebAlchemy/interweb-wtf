# interweb.wtf

> A privacy-focused, user-centric URL shortener for the modern interweb.

WTF Links work just like the shortlinks you're used to except that they don't track you, once they've been created the URL they point to cannot be updated, and you can add `/info` to any WTF Link to see where it's taking you.

## Shortlink Expander

Interweb.wtf also supports expanding shortened links from other providers and removing tracking parameters.

**Note**: This example is expanding [https://bit.ly/prompt-injection-guide](https://bit.ly/prompt-injection-guide) which is a shortlink that I included in a slide for a [talk I gave about Prompt Injection](https://youtu.be/BXiJO-h51CY?si=uzQwxoFBt4TVmfuz&t=25192).

## URL Cleaner

Interweb.wtf also provides a [URL Cleaner](https://www.interweb.wtf/docs/clean) that removes tracking parameters from any URL.
