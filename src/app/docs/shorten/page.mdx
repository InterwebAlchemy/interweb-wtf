## URL shortening

The Interweb.WTF URL shortening service allows you to shorten URLs into easily shareable [WTF Links](/docs/concepts/wtf-links) without any [tracking parameters](/docs/concepts/tracking).

To shorten a URL, you can use the [Dashboard Shortener](#dashboard-shortener) on your [Dashboard](/dashboard) or the [Global Shortener](#global-shortener) in the navigation menu.

### Dashboard Shortener

The [Dashboard](/dashboard) lists all of your WTF Links and includes a text input that allows you to turn any URL that isn't a shortlink into a WTF Link.

### Global Shortener

The global input in the navigation menu takes the same text input from your [Dashboard](/dashboard) and allows you to use it anywhere on the Interweb.WTF site.

To access the global input, click on your user avatar in the top-right corner of the site.

**Note**: To avoid race conditions from creating multiple shortlinks, the global input is not available while viewing the [Dashboard](/dashboard), use the [Dashboard Shortener](#dashboard-shortener) instead.
