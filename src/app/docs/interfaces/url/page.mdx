## URL Interface

The URL Interface is a way for users to interact with Interweb.WTF from the address bar of their browser or via shared links.

With the URL Interface, you can:

- [Preview a WTF Link](/docs/concepts/wtf-links)
- [Expand a shortlink](/docs/expand)
- [Clean a URL](/docs/clean)

**Note**: To help simplify working with the URL Interface, the `interweb.wtf` domain does not require you to use `https://` or `www.` in the URL. It will automatically redirect to the correct format.

### Examples

- [interweb.wtf/go/patient-recipe/info](https://www.interweb.wtf/go/patient-recipe/info): renders a preview of the destination of the [WTF Link](/docs/concepts/wtf-links)
- [interweb.wtf/is/https://bit.ly/1sNZMwL](https://www.interweb.wtf/is/https://bit.ly/1sNZMwL): performs [URL Expansion](/docs/expand) on the shortlink and displays the preview page
- [interweb.wtf/clean/https://interwebalchemy.com/posts/building-a-chess-tutor?utm_source=interweb.wtf&utm_campaign=docs](https://www.interweb.wtf/clean/https://interwebalchemy.com/posts/building-a-chess-tutor?utm_source=interweb.wtf&utm_campaign=docs): performs [URL Cleaning](/docs/clean) on the URL and displays the cleaned URL
