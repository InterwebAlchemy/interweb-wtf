## API Interface

The API Interface is a way for developers to interact with the basic functionality of Interweb.WTF from their own applications.

With the API Interface, you can:

- [Resolve a WTF Link to it's destination URL](/docs/concepts/wtf-links)
- [Clean a URL](/docs/clean)
- [Expand a shortlink](/docs/expand)

All you need is an [API Key](/settings/developer).

Learn more in the [API Documentation](/docs/cli)
