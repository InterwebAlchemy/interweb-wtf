## Interfaces

Interweb.WTF has three main interfaces for interacting with the service:

- [Web Interface](/docs/interfaces/web)
- [URL Interface](/docs/interfaces/url)
- [API Interface](/docs/interfaces/api)

Each interface has it's own set of features and capabilities, but they all share the same core functionality and philosophy..
