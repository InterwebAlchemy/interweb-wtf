## Shortlinks

Shortlinks are the simpler, shareable URLs generated by [URL shortening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) services.

They are easier to share in situations where text length is limited, like:

- in a microblog post, like a Tweet
- on a slide during a presentation
- typing a URL from a printed document
- reading a URL out loud to someone
- printing a URL in a document
