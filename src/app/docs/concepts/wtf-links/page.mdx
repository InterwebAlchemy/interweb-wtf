## WTF Links

WTF Links are [shortlinks](/docs/concepts/shortlinks) created by Interweb.WTF.

They are easy to share URLs that do not include any tracking parameters and any WTF Link can be viewed before being redirected to it by appending `/info` to the WTF Link URL.

### Example

If you navigate to [interweb.wtf/patient-recipe/info](https://www.interweb.wtf/patient-recipe/info), you will be presented with an information page that allows you to preview what that WTF Link points to.

### QR Code

WTF Links also generate an Interweb.WTF-branded QR Code for each WTF Link, in the **QR Code** tab.

You can download the QR Code to share it by clicking the **Download QR Code** button.
