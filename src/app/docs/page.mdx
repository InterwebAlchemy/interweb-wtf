Interweb.WTF is a privacy-focused, user-centric URL shortening service.

## Getting Started

<Alert icon={<IconInfoCircle />} color="teal">
  <Text>
    The Interweb.WTF is currently in beta and **invite-only**.
  </Text>
</Alert>

Once you've been granted access, you can use the Interweb.WTF service, you can:

- [shorten URLs](/docs/shorten) into easily shareable [WTF Links](/docs/concepts/wtf-links) without any [tracking parameters](/docs/concepts/tracking)
- [expand shorlinks](/docs/expand) from other services while removing [tracking parameters](/docs/concepts/tracking) from them
- [clean](/docs/clean) any known [tracking parameters](/docs/concepts/tracking) from any URL
- [programmatically](/docs/cli) interact with the [Interweb.WTF CLI API](/docs/cli/v0) and manage your [API keys](/settings/developer)

## Interfaces

Part of being user-centric is providing multiple ways of interfacing with the service.

- the [web-based interface](/docs/interfaces/web) for shortening, expanding, and cleaning URLs uses a simple, clean interface with text inputs and buttons
- the [URL-based interface](/docs/interfaces/url) for shortening, expanding, and cleaning URLs uses your browser's address bar and `interweb.wtf` URLs
- the [API-based interface](/docs/cli/) for shortening, expanding, and cleaning URLs uses a text-based [API](/docs/cli/v0) and [API Keys](/settings/developer)
